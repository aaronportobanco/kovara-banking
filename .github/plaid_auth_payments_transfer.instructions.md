# Auth Payment Partners

#### Find payment providers who have partnered with Plaid to provide general purpose ACH money movement

\=\*=\*=\*=

#### Overview

Many Plaid developers choose to use a Plaid partner to move money with Auth. You will use Plaid Link initialized with the Auth product, but instead of using Plaid Auth endpoints, you will use endpoints from the payment platform, giving you access to payment functionality while freeing you from having to securely store sensitive bank account information.

The following is a list of payments platforms who have partnered with Plaid to provide ACH money movement via a special processor token, along with instructions on how to enable those integrations.

#### Global payments options

Money movement via Plaid partners is only available for financial institutions within the US (with multiple providers above) and Canada (with [VoPay](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/partnerships/vopay/index.html.md) , [Modern Treasury](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/partnerships/modern-treasury/index.html.md) , or [Finix](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/partnerships/finix/index.html.md) ).

#### Example code in Plaid Pattern

For a real-life example of an app that incorporates the creation of processor tokens, see the Node-based [Plaid Pattern Account Funding](https://github.com/plaid/pattern-account-funding) sample app. Pattern Account Funding is a sample account funding app that creates a processor token to send to your payment partner. The processor token creation code can be found in [items.js](https://github.com/plaid/pattern-account-funding/blob/master/server/routes/items.js#L126-L135) .

For a tutorial walkthrough of creating a similar app, see [Account funding tutorial](https://github.com/plaid/account-funding-tutorial) .
