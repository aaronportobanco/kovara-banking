### Introduction

Let’s test out running Plaid locally by cloning the Quickstart app. You’ll need API keys, which you can receive by signing up in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/developers/keys) .

You'll have two different API keys, and there are three different Plaid environments. Today we'll start in the Sandbox environment. View the API Keys section of the Dashboard to find your Sandbox secret.

###### API Key

If you get stuck at any point in the Quickstart, help is just a click away! Check the Quickstart [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/plaid/quickstart#troubleshooting) or ask other developers in our [Stack Overflow community](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/plaid) .

### Quickstart setup

Once you have your API keys, it's time to run the Plaid Quickstart locally! The instructions below will guide you through the process of cloning the [Quickstart repository](https://github.com/plaid/quickstart) , customizing the .env file with your own Plaid client ID and Sandbox secret, and finally, building and running the app.

Plaid offers both Docker and non-Docker options for the Quickstart. If you don't have Docker installed, you may wish to use the non-Docker version; this path is especially recommended for Windows users who do not have Docker installations. However, if you already have Docker installed, we recommend the Docker option because it is simpler and easier to run the Quickstart. Below are instructions on setting up the Quickstart with Docker and non-Docker configurations.

Non-DockerDocker

#### Setting up without Docker

Make sure you have [npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) before following along. If you're using Windows, ensure you have a terminal capable of running basic Unix shell commands.

```bash
# Note: If on Windows, run
# git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/plaid/quickstart
# instead to ensure correct symlink behavior


git clone https://github.com/plaid/quickstart.git


# Copy the .env.example file to .env, then fill
# out PLAID_CLIENT_ID and PLAID_SECRET in .env
cp .env.example .env


cd quickstart/node


# Install dependencies
npm install


# Start the backend app
./start.sh
```

Open a new shell and start the frontend app. Your app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd quickstart/frontend
npm install


# Start the frontend app
npm start


# Go to http://localhost:3000
```

Visit localhost and log in with Sandbox credentials (typically `user_good` and `pass_good`, as indicated at the bottom of the page).

#### Setting up with Docker

Docker is a software platform that packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run, including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. If you don't already have Docker, you can [download it from the Docker site](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) . Note that Windows users may need to take some additional steps, such installing a Linux environment; if you are using Windows and do not already have a Linux environment installed, we recommend selecting the non-Docker instructions instead.

Once Docker is installed, launch the Docker app, then use the following commands at the command line to configure and run the Quickstart. If the `make` commands do not work, ensure that Docker is running. You may also need to prefix the `make` commands with `sudo`, depending on your environment.

```bash
# Note: If on Windows, run
# git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/plaid/quickstart
# instead to ensure correct symlink behavior


git clone https://github.com/plaid/quickstart.git
cd quickstart


# Copy the .env.example file to .env, then fill
# out PLAID_CLIENT_ID and PLAID_SECRET in .env
cp .env.example .env


# start the container for one of these languages:
# node, python, java, ruby, or go


make up language=node


# Go to http://localhost:3000
```

Visit localhost and log in with Sandbox credentials (typically `user_good` and `pass_good`, as indicated at the bottom of the page).

```bash
$ make logs language=node
```

```bash
$ make stop language=node
```

#### Create your first Item

Most API requests interact with an _Item_, which is a Plaid term for a login at a financial institution. A single end-user of your application might have accounts at different financial institutions, which means they would have multiple different Items. An Item is not the same as a financial institution account, although every account will be associated with an Item. For example, if a user has one login at their bank that allows them to access both their checking account and their savings account, a single Item would be associated with both of those accounts.

Now that you have the Quickstart running, you’ll add your first Item in the Sandbox environment. Once you’ve opened the Quickstart app on localhost, click the **Launch Link** button and select any institution. Use the Sandbox credentials to simulate a successful login.

##### Sandbox credentials

```bash
username: user_good
password: pass_good
If prompted to enter a 2FA code: 1234
```

Once you have entered your credentials and moved to the next screen, you have created your first Item! You can now make API calls for that Item by using the buttons in the Quickstart. In the next section, we'll explain what actually happened and how the Quickstart works.

### How it works

As you might have noticed, you use both a server and a client-side component to access the Plaid APIs. The flow looks like this:

**The Plaid flow** begins when your user wants to connect their bank account to your app.

(An image of "Step diagram")

**1**Call [/link/token/create](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/index.html.md#linktokencreate) to create a `link_token` and pass the temporary token to your app's client.

(An image of "Step 1 diagram")

**2**Use the `link_token` to open Link for your user. In the [onSuccess callback](https://plaid.com/docs/link/web/index.html.md#onsuccess) , Link will provide a temporary `public_token`. This token can also be obtained on the backend via \`/link/token/get\`.

(An image of "Step 2 diagram")

**3**Call [/item/public_token/exchange](https://plaid.com/docs/api/items/index.html.md#itempublic_tokenexchange) to exchange the `public_token` for a permanent `access_token` and `item_id` for the new `Item`.

(An image of "Step 3 diagram")

**4**Store the `access_token` and use it to make product requests for your user's `Item`.

(An image of "Step 4 diagram")

The first step is to create a new `link_token` by making a [/link/token/create](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/index.html.md#linktokencreate) request and passing in the required configurations. This `link_token` is a short lived, one-time use token that authenticates your app with [Plaid Link](https://plaid.com/docs/link/index.html.md) , our frontend module. Several of the environment variables you configured when launching the Quickstart, such as `PLAID_PRODUCTS`, are used as parameters for the `link_token`.

```javascript
app.post('/api/create_link_token', async function (request, response) {
  // Get the client_user_id by searching for the current user
  const user = await User.find(...);
  const clientUserId = user.id;
  const request = {
    user: {
      // This should correspond to a unique id for the current user.
      client_user_id: clientUserId,
    },
    client_name: 'Plaid Test App',
    products: ['auth'],
    language: 'en',
    webhook: 'https://webhook.example.com',
    redirect_uri: 'https://domainname.com/oauth-page.html',
    country_codes: ['US'],
  };
  try {
    const createTokenResponse = await client.linkTokenCreate(request);
    response.json(createTokenResponse.data);
  } catch (error) {
    // handle error
  }
});
```

Once you have a `link_token`, you can use it to initialize [Link](https://plaid.com/docs/link/index.html.md) . Link is a drop-in client-side module available for web, iOS, and Android that handles the authentication process. The Quickstart uses Plaid's optional React bindings for an integration that you trigger via your own client-side code. This is what your users use to log into their financial institution accounts.

After a user submits their credentials within Link, Link provides you with a `public_token` via the `onSuccess` callback. The code below shows how the Quickstart passes the `public_token` from client-side code to the server. Both React and vanilla JavaScript examples are shown.

```tsx
// APP COMPONENT
// Upon rendering of App component, make a request to create and
// obtain a link token to be used in the Link component
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { usePlaidLink } from 'react-plaid-link';
const App = () => {
  const [linkToken, setLinkToken] = useState(null);
  const generateToken = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/create_link_token', {
      method: 'POST',
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    setLinkToken(data.link_token);
  };
  useEffect(() => {
    generateToken();
  }, []);
  return linkToken != null ?  : <>;
};
// LINK COMPONENT
// Use Plaid Link and pass link token and onSuccess function
// in configuration to initialize Plaid Link
interface LinkProps {
  linkToken: string | null;
}
const Link: React.FC = (props: LinkProps) => {
  const onSuccess = React.useCallback((public_token, metadata) => {
    // send public_token to server
    const response = fetch('/api/set_access_token', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ public_token }),
    });
    // Handle response ...
  }, []);
  const config: Parameters[0] = {
    token: props.linkToken!,
    onSuccess,
  };
  const { open, ready } = usePlaidLink(config);
  return (
     open()} disabled={!ready}>
      Link account

  );
};
export default App;
```

Next, on the server side, the Quickstart calls [/item/public_token/exchange](https://plaid.com/docs/api/items/index.html.md#itempublic_tokenexchange) to obtain an `access_token`, as illustrated in the code excerpt below. The `access_token` uniquely identifies an Item and is a required argument for most Plaid API endpoints. In your own code, you'll need to securely store your `access_token` in order to make API requests for that Item.

Current librariesLegacy libraries

```javascript
app.post("/api/exchange_public_token", async function (request, response, next) {
  const publicToken = request.body.public_token;
  try {
    const response = await client.itemPublicTokenExchange({
      public_token: publicToken,
    });

    // These values should be saved to a persistent database and
    // associated with the currently signed-in user
    const accessToken = response.data.access_token;
    const itemID = response.data.item_id;

    res.json({ public_token_exchange: "complete" });
  } catch (error) {
    // handle error
  }
});
```

#### Making API requests

Now that we've gone over the Link flow and token exchange process, we can explore what happens when you press a button in the Quickstart to make an API call. As an example, we'll look at the Quickstart's call to [/accounts/get](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/index.html.md#accountsget) , which retrieves basic information, such as name and balance, about the accounts associated with an Item. The call is fairly straightforward and uses the `access_token` as a single argument to the Plaid client object.

```javascript
app.get("/api/accounts", async function (request, response, next) {
  try {
    const accountsResponse = await client.accountsGet({
      access_token: accessToken,
    });
    prettyPrintResponse(accountsResponse);
    response.json(accountsResponse.data);
  } catch (error) {
    prettyPrintResponse(error);
    return response.json(formatError(error.response));
  }
});
```

Example response data:

```json

  "accounts": [
    {
      "account_id": "A3wenK5EQRfKlnxlBbVXtPw9gyazDWu1EdaZD",
